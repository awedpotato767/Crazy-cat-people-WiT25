# Crazy-cat-people-WiT25

This repository contains the Crazy Cat people team's project for the Women in Tech society hackathon 2025.

This year's theme was "reinventing the wheel"

# "Learnout; study wellbeing companion"
We have decided to reinvent study focus apps (like the popular "forest" app) to have a greater positive impact on wellbeing for some people.


## _(gaaaawd! /lyr)_ What have we done?

This project aims to provide a study tool to encourage people to work in a way that suits them.
Many people (the team included) find the patters some study helpers promote unhealthy; Forest, for example, punishes you if you do nnot work for as long as you planned. This is unhelpful for those with a disability, as prioritising study over our needs is not sustainable.
Hence our app, learnout, will not punish people for "failing" to focus. It's design is oriented around letting people know when and how they study best.
The main user interface has a "study" button, then two "break" buttons for different types of breaks, to gather data about study habits. When each session is over, the user will rate how they felt in that session.
After this data is collected, it produces a graph reviewing several statistics such as study quality vs total break time, to enable the user to see correlations.
